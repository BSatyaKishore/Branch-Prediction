## Branch Prediction
Branch Prediction Algorithm for OutOfOrder Pipelines within area budgets of 1200bits, 2400bits and 3600bits

## Synopsis
The major gaol of this project is to implement a branch predictor, that satisfies given area constraints and achieves as much accuracy as possible.

## Running
bash build.sh $Area_Constraint
Ex: bash build.sh 1200
